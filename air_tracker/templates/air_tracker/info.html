                Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies
                the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires
                are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone,
                nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and is an important source
                of morbidity and mortality.

                Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. WHO data shows that almost all of the global population
                (99%) breathe air that exceeds <a href="https://who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789240034228">WHO guideline</a> limits containing
                high levels of <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/types-of-pollutants">pollutants</a>,
                with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. WHO is supporting countries to address air pollution.

                From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. The combined effects
                of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause millions of premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality
                from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.
